# Code Institute's User Centric Frontend Development.
## Project submission by Stuart Green.

### Project Overview
Website design for iconic 60s rock band,  The Monkees. If you're a Monkees fan, this is where you need to be. This hip new online spot for them boasts everything from information about the band members themselves, to tour dates, music playlists and even a cool way to get in touch. Hope you'll enjoy! Monkey on!

### UX
This website was designed for fans of The Monkees, young boomers. Therefore, I have chosen to keep the design / user experience quite modern and trendy, as that fits the typical Monkee fan.

I believe that a Monkee fan would want to be able to do a few simple things:

1. Find out when The Monkees are going to be touring, and get tickets.
2. Listen to music by The Monkees.
3. Get in touch with The Monkees.

My process was quite simple, I got my wife who is around the age of a typical Monkees fan and asked her what she would want to see from the website.

She said, if she were a user then she'd simply want to be able to easily access their music with the possiblity of listening to more 'similar' songs.
She also said that the website should be simple and intuitive, whilst being modern and trendy, just as The Monkees are.

From this, I took that it was important to maintain the image of The Monkees, and build the website to the spec of a younger generation, and by that I mean, modern, more outlandish than if you were to build a website for say, a bakery or an old peoples home.

I took to pen and paper to mockup the website look and feel with a lo-fi mockup. I then asked my wife (my user case) for her thoughts and tweaked accordingly in a hi-fi mockup.

Both mockups can be found by going to the mockups directory.

### Features
Video background - Large video banner, this was as per the requirements of the client, but helps to immediately identify what website it is, and what its about.
*I used vide.js for the video background, link can be found in the references below.

Spotify playlist - Embedded right into the website and fully responsive. Great for listening to music, a must have feature for any trendy music listener.

Events - The client requested the ability to book them for events, so I implemented a feature that allows the user to easily book them for a magnitude of events.

Tour dates - Ability to view a list of tour dates, and book tickets accordingly.

Social media - Links to social media, so their fans can interact with them.

### Features that could be later implemented
I think it'd be great if there was a way to live stream events/tours, something like what you find on the IRL section of Twitch these days.

It could also be cool if there was a forum, or blogs or some way for the band to directly contact their fans at large.

### Technologies Used
Here's a list of technologies used:
1. HTML5 - Used for marking up the DOM of the website.
2. CSS3 - Used to style the website and make it pretty.
3. JavaScript - Used to add functionality to the website, i.e. the header hamburger menu on mobile.
4. [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) - Framework, used to quickly build the base of the website.
5. [Cloud9/C9](https://c9.io) - IDE that I used to work on my project (just like a text editor / terminal).
6. [Git](https://git-scm.com/) - Used to ensure that I have version control on my project.
7. [Github](https://github.com/) - I used Github Pages to set the website live.
8. [Browserstack](https://www.browserstack.com/) - Test the website

### jQuery
The project uses jQuery to simplify DOM manipulation.

### Testing
I tested my project on mobile, tablet and desktop using a tool called Browserstack, screenshots can be found in the testing directory.

I also manually tested multiple elements of the website myself to ensure that they were working correctly, such as:

1. Links on the menus, i.e. header/footer as well as tour dates, etc.
2. Spotify embeds, to ensure music plays accordingly
3. Contact form fields (for validation purposes). I tested an empty form, all fields filled in as well as filling in an invalid email address.

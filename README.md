# Code Institute's User Centric Frontend Development.
## Project submission by Stuart Green.

### Brief
Build a static (front-end only) website for a band. As a starting point, you may want to use wireframes, as we did in the UX lesson (you can use Balsamiq or any other tool, including just pen and paper)

The band is a 1960’s rock band and have around 50 years experience of performing live at numerous events around the world. You have been given the following requirements after interviews with the client’s representatives:

1. Their primary target audiences are their fans and potential fans who wish to use the site to see and hear clips from their back catalog, and any new material as it becomes available.
2. Also, the band would like to use the site to showcase their music and publicise their availability to perform at events such as weddings and Christmas parties.

The band has provided you, the developer, with the following assets that they would like to showcase on their website:

1. Photos of the band members
2. A video clip
3. Audio clips

Also, they are in the process of creating a social media presence and would like to add links to their Facebook, Twitter and YouTube pages.

### Requirements
1. Create a 4-5 page website.
2. Incorporate main navigation and grid layout.
3. Use semantic HTML5 elements.
4. Make the site responsive.
5. Test the sites responsiveness.
6. Conduct tests to ensure functionality works well.
7. Write a README file that explains what the project does and needs it fulfills. It should also describe functionality of the project as well as technologies used. Detail how the project was deployed and tested and if some of the work was based on other code, explain what was kept and how it was changed to fit your needs.
8. Use Git and Github for version control.
9. Deploy the final version to Github Pages.

### Project Overview
This is a website created for iconic 60s band, the Monkees. The main purpose of this website is to attract the bands fanbase, as well as potential new fans to listen to their music, find out tour dates, and potentially book them for private events, such as praties, weddings, etc.

### Technologies Used
Here's a list of technologies used:
1. HTML5
2. CSS3
3. JavaScript
4. Bootstrap
5. Cloud9
6. Git
7. Github (Github Pages)

### Development Process
I first started out by going and having a Google around, as well as looking at some of the websites in the music industry, using websites such as Awwwards, Pinterest, Behance and others.

After I had had a look around at competitors for inspiration, I then sat down and thought about why I'm building this website, what the use case of the website is and how I can give the user what they want easily.

I then created some use stories, I'll detail one below:

1. As a user, I want to be able to listen to music, if there's a song I don't know about by a band I like, I want to find it.

Based on the information I collected from my research. I then went on to build a lo fi mockup, and then shared it with my wife (she's a good use-case as she isn't very tech savvy) and asked her for her thoughts. I then went on to mockup a hi fi mockup based on the response.

From here, I went on to build out the project using the technologies above. I documented my HTML and CSS with comments, making it easy to understand for others.

During this time, as a feature was implemented, it got backed up in my version control software, Git, and every time a feature was implemented, it was tested on multiple screen sizes and devices.
